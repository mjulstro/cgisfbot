# cgisfbot
This is a Tumblr bot that produces random sentences. The goal is to be grammatically correct but meaningless, like the famous "colorless green ideas sleep furiously."

Currently, the bot only produces present-tense sentences, because I didn't want to try to code conjugation. Potential future todos include:
- prepositions and prepositional phrases
- interjections
- past and future tenses (and participles?!)
- plural nouns and the verbs that conjugate for them
- more advanced punctuation
- verbs that are phrases ("puts out", "eats up", "doubles down", "gets nerfed")
- helping verbs
- the passive voice?

The bot's vocabulary comes mostly from EnchantedLearning.com. Its adjectives are from http://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/adjectives.shtml, its verbs are from http://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/verbs.shtml, and its adverbs are from http://www.enchantedlearning.com/wordlist/adverbs.shtml. However, Enchanted Learning doesn't have a nouns sheet, so I took the noun list from Talk English at https://www.talkenglish.com/vocabulary/top-1500-nouns.aspx. I also modified the lists a little to include words like "scalie," "lawyer," "bisexual," and "glomp."

I would love contributions to this repo! Like I said above, there's a lot I haven't done with this bot, and realistically, I'm not going to any time soon; it's a fun project I'm doing on a whim, and it's at the mercy of my work schedule and my level of interest. But it'd be sweet if it became collaborative!
